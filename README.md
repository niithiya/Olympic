# Olympic

This is a dataset from Datacamp that I utilized to perform simple queries using PostgreSQL.

This repository contains the Olympic dataset in csv format and the queries.

The data set is from 1896-2012, which details the city the Olympics took place, sport, discipline, names of athletes, country the athletes were from, gender of athletes, events they participated in as well as the medal they won.

I adopted a macro to micro approach, by looking at the overall statistics and narrowed down to how women performed in the Olympics.

Feel free to use the dataset and query away!
